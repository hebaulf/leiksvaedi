# Algolia Site Search - React Instantsearch

The purpose of this project is for people (parents mostly) to be able to search and filter results for playgrounds, sled slopes or other open-area spaces based on criteria, with descriptions and other information, images and location.  

I did this using [React InstantSearch](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/what-is-instantsearch/react/), which is a library for building super fast search-as-you-type search UI's with [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/), a search API.
